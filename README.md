# Home Assistant Config

This is the story of my Home Assistant deployment (actually my second deployment).  I first started using home assistant at our first home, and now we have moved into our longer term family home (2 kids) I get to start the journey again.

I will make an effort to keep this up to date, and product updates on what I am doing to create a 'smarter home'.
